Exploring the world, one step at a time.

I am a Machine Learning Software Engineer at Google, where I work on the Gemini team, focusing on advancing large multimodal language models to enhance reasoning, planning, and instruction-following capabilities. My role involves cutting-edge applied research in synthetic data generation, addressing AI data scarcity issues, and developing innovative solutions for human-centered, large-scale applications. Previously, at NVIDIA, I contributed to the autonomous vehicle team, optimizing ML flow and workflow designs to maximize the efficiency of computing resources in large-scale training and inference tasks.

My academic background includes an M.S. in Computer Science from Columbia University, where I completed a thesis in Multi-Modal Learning and Natural Language Processing under the guidance of Prof. Kathleen McKeown. I also hold a B.Tech. in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), where I graduated with the highest academic rank. Throughout my career, I have had the privilege of interning with leading technology companies such as Apple and Adobe, where I developed and deployed advanced machine learning models to solve complex, multimodal problems in various domains.
